## Minigame task description

Minigames come as a controled environments that might be useful to exploit game features in SC2. General purpose learning system for Startcraft 2 can be a daunting task. So there is a logical option in splitting this tasks into minitask in orther to advance in research . Mini-games focus on different elements of Starcraft II Gameplay .

To investigate elements of the game in isolation, and to provide further fine-grained steps towards playing the full game, Deepmind has built several mini-games. These are focused scenarios on small maps that have been constructed with the purpose of testing a subset of actions and/or game mechanics with a clear reward structure. Unlike the full game where the reward is just win/lose/tie, the reward structure for mini-games can reward particular behaviours (as defined in a corresponding .SC2Map file).
